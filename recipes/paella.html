    <h3>An Amazing Vegetarian Paella Recipe</h3>
    <p>A much-loved vegetarian paella recipe. And, for this veg-centric, California-inspired take on the Spanish classic, you don't need a special pan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 spring carrots, 1/4-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 bunch of scallions or spring onions, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups short-grain paella rice</li>
        <li>1 cup <a href="sofrito.html">sofrito</a></li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron threads</li>
        <li>3 cups of bite-sized mixed vegetables: asparagus, peas, cherry</li>
        <li>tomatoes, summer squash, baby artichokes (trimmed and quartered)</li>
        <li>baby radish</li>
        <li>5 cups hot vegetable stock</li>
        <li>toppings: lemon slices / olives / toasted sliced almonds / chopped</li>
        <li>herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat the olive oil in a large (11 1/2-inch skillet) over medium heat- if you don't have a skillet that large, use a 9 1/2-inch skillet and cut the recipe in half. Sauce the carrots, scallions (or spring onions), until translucent. Stir in the garlic, and let it cook a little longer. Add the rice, stir well, and cook until the grains are also translucent, a few minutes - be mindful to not allow the rice to burn. Stir in the sofrito. Add the paprika. Crush the saffron with your fingers, and add that as well.</li>
        <li>Stir in the vegetables, pour the hot stock over all of it, stir, and bring to a moderate simmer. No more stirring allowed. Simmer for exactly 17 minutes. Set a timer. Taste the stock and re-season if necessary.</li>
        <li>Move the paella to the oven and bake for another 12 minutes. Remove, and if you want to try to get a bit more crust on the base of your paella, and you’re confident your paella won’t burn, return the paella to a burner for another minute or so. Remove from heat and allow it to rest for another few minutes. Top with anything else you like - olives, nuts, lemons, herbs, etc. Serve family style in the pan.</li>
