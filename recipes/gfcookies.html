    <h3>The Best Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
    <p>The BEST Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies! A few tricks make these gluten-free cookies perfect – soft, chewy, golden and irresistible! Easy-to-make and NOBODY will guess they are gluten-free!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 stick butter, ½ cup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or almond milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (I highly recommend this brand for best results - be sure to get one that contains xanthan gum), 7.5 ounces</li>
        <li>¼ cup almond flour, 1 ounce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Sea salt for sprinkling, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, almond flour, baking soda and salt until evenly combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted start to whisk constantly. First the butter will begin to foam, then after a couple of minutes it will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan. Turn off the heat as soon as the solids turn brown and the butter gives off a nutty aroma. Pour into a glass mixing bowl to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, brown sugar and white sugar. Whisk to combine. Add the egg and vanilla and whisk until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, mix in the dry ingredients until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F. Scoop the cookie dough (about 2 Tablespoons of dough per cookie) and place a few inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden and the center is set.</li>
        <li>Let cool 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling. Enjoy!</li>
