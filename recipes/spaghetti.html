    <h3>Spaghetti with No-Cook Sauce</h3>
    <p>A tangle of spaghetti, olives, nuts, vegetables, and torn mozzarella in a no-cook, lemon-zested tomato sauce. A recipe for a hot night when tomato season is at its peak.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (~3 large), quartered, seeds removed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>scant teaspoon fine grain sea salt</li>
        <li>2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 pound whole grain spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound string beans or broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2/3 cup torn Kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1/2 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
        <li>1/2 pound cherry tomatoes, halved (~2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 cup torn mozzarella</li>
        <li>Slivered fresh basil or fresh lemon verbena (or crushed dried lemon verbena), to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, slice the larger tomatoes (1 1/2 pounds) into bite-sized chunks and place in a large serving bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with the garlic, salt, and zest of one of the lemons. Squeeze a tablespoon of lemon juice into the mixture, and use a hand blender to pulse a few times, into a chunky sauce.</li>
        <li>Salt the pasta water well, and cook the pasta per package instructions. Add the sting beans or broccoli to the pasta water in the last minute of cooking. Drain the pasta and vegetables and transfer to the bowl with the tomato sauce. Toss well. Add half the olives, half the pine nuts, and half of the cherry tomatoes. Add all of the mozzarella. Toss well, and top with the zest of the second lemon, and the remaining olives, pine nuts, and tomatoes. </li>
        <li>Top with basil or lemon verbena, serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
